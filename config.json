This had nothing to do with us and was totally outside our control. Subtract those 1,000 bots and we are at about 767 followers. Because of all this, we've decided that we will have another Hoppy Hour once we reach 2,000 followers in order to not encourage others to buy bot followers on our account! In other news, progress is going VERY well on the brand!",
